                <p>Floods are among the most frequent and costly natural disasters in the United States and account for
                    approximately 30% of disasters worldwide. Flooding typically occurs after heavy or prolonged
                    rainfall,
                    or the rapid melt of snow. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the
                        charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity
                        on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has
                        on their own lives.

                        So why is giving to charity so gratifying? We’ve taken a closer look at five reasons to donate
                        to your charities of choice. </p>
